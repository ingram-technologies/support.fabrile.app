# Quick Guide: Build and Deploy Agents

Hello!

Fabrile, as you may already know, is a no-code platform that empowers businesses to create **AI-driven agents** for automating workflows, enhancing customer support, and generating leads. It integrates seamlessly with tools like Gmail, GDrive, Calendar, and more—enabling users to deploy intelligent, branded AI agents quickly and efficiently.

This guide is designed to help you create an agent in under **30 minutes**. To illustrate the process, we’ll use examples from the steps we followed to build **Fabby**, our mascot support agent embedded on our website's Contact Page. Let’s dive in:

## Step 1: Log In

Log into your Fabrile account: [Log In Link](#)

## Step 2: Create Your Agent

Click **Create Your Agent** in the top-right corner and choose from the available templates. These templates are fully customizable and provide a starting point if one fits your needs. If none of the templates work for you, select **Custom Agent** from the dropdown menu to build your agent from scratch.

## Step 3: Configure Your Agent

Once created, you'll be guided to the configuration page. Here are the components that give life to your agent:

- **Agent Name:** Choose a name that reflects your brand and purpose.  
  *Example:* `Fabby - Contact Us`
- **Internal Description:** Briefly describe the agent’s core identity.  
  *Example:* `Embedded on [fabrile.app/contact](https://fabrile.app/contact)`
- **Welcome Message (Optional):** The initial greeting from your agent.  
  *Example:* `Hi! Talk to me. You can ask any questions, and I'll forward any feedback to our team.`
- **Instructions:** Describe your agent’s identity, purpose, and scope. Explain where the agent is embedded, the type of users it may interact with, and any key behaviors (e.g., sending emails or collecting contact details).
- **Suggested Messages:** List common questions or inputs that users might click on.  
  *Example:* “I have a question”, “I found a bug”, “I want to share some feedback”

## Step 4: Customize the Interface

After configuration, click on the **Interface & Styling** page on the left to customize your agent's look. Pay special attention to the **Placeholder text**—the grayed-out text in the input field (e.g., *Type something here…*).

## Step 5: View Conversation History

Click on **Conversation History** to see interactions with your agent. This area will populate once your agent is used.

## Step 6: Feed Your Agent Data

Feed data into your agent through the **Knowledge Base**. You can upload files, add websites, or integrate with Notion so the agent has the information it needs to do its job effectively.

## Step 7: Enable Integrations

Visit the **Memory** page to explore the available tools and integrations. For example, connecting to Gmail enables your agent to read and send emails on your behalf, significantly enhancing its capabilities.

## Step 8: Embed and Share

Finally, go to the **Embed & Share** page, make your agent public, and copy the embed code to insert into your HTML. You can also share the direct link via email, social media, or anywhere you’d like users to interact with your agent.
